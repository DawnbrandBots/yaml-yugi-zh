# YAML Yugi (中文)

The [YAML Yugi](https://github.com/DawnbrandBots/yaml-yugi) project aims to create a comprehensive, machine-readable,
human-editable database of the _Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game_ and _Official Card Game_. This is a regularly-updated
collection of Simplified Chinese translations of Yu-Gi-Oh! card text scraped from [OurOCG](https://www.ourocg.cn/).
It gets merged with other data sources and transformed into the final database in the main repository.

All files under [`/zh-CN`](/zh-CN) are extracted from scraped web pages.
